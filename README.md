# Bank-Statement-Analyzer
A bank statement analyzer in Java.

This is the project in Java from the book Real-World Software Development by the authors Richard Warburton & Raoul-Gabriel. The authors suggested that I should add a basic gui as an exercise to this project, but I have decided not to do that on the account of my blindness. The program runs fine from the command line.

I do plan to implement this project in Rust in the future, once I get good enough with that language. If I get any feature ideas, I will put it in that future Rust implementation.
